Question - 1
To detect a stuck at fault, error signal must be propagated (must affect the value).This is called

---> fault termination
---> fault propagation *
---> fault nulification
---> fault improvisation

Question - 2
ATPG is a tool that can ascertain presence and abscence of faults at some locations in the circuits.ATPG stand for

---> Automatic Test Pattern Group
---> Automatic Technology Pattern Generation
---> Automatic Test Pattern Generation *
---> Automatic Technology Pattern Group

Question - 3
In order to detect a fault at 'h', we need to provide fault-free logic value at 'h' location.This is called

---> Fault activation *
---> fault termination
---> fault removal
---> fault improvisation

Question - 4
It is always possible to detect a Stuck-at-0 fault using some input values.

---> True *
---> False

Question - 5
By considering Stuck-at-0 fault (line always passes signal 0) at different locations, all the SA0 fault cases can be identified
---> True*
---> False
